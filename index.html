<p>
Go to this <a href="#">link</a> to access the game. This page is the backend server.
<br/>
the game rule is, well... just like Connect4!
<br/>
Your task is to create a bot or Artificial Intelligence that can play Connect4 automatically. Your bot will play against a bot that you select. The stronger your opponent, the higher the score that you will get!
<br/>
Here are pre-defined methods with default code for both Python and JavaScript that you have to complete:
</p>
<p>Python Code:</p>
<pre><code>def move(board):
    # start your code here
    # must return integer which is the column index
    return randint(0,6);
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript Code:</p>
<pre><code>
function  move(board){
    # start your code here
    # must return integer which is the column index
    return Math.floor(Math.random()*6)
}</code></pre>

<p>
Here is the Data Structure of the Board to help you write your bot, it is a 2D array - 6 columns and 7 rows:</p>
<pre><code>
[ ["_", "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" ],
  ["_", "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" ],
  ["_", "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" ],
  ["_", "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" ],
  ["_", "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" ],
  ["_", "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" , "_" ] ]
</code></pre>

<p>Here are some rules that you should follow:
    <ul>
        <li>in every step, the bot should return an integer, which is the column index</li>
        <li>you must login using facebook first in order to submit code</li>
    </ul>
<br/>
Last but not least, Happy Playing!!!
